# Linux file structure


### Root

* Every single file and directory starts from the root directory.
* Only root user has write privilege under this directory.
* Please note that /root is root user’s home directory, which is not same as /.

###/bin – User Binaries

* Contains binary executables.
* Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
* Commands used by all the users of the system are located here.
* For example: ps, ls, ping, grep, cp.

### sbin – System Binaries

* Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
* But, the linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system aministrator, for system * maintenance purpose.
* For example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon

### /etc – Configuration Files

* Contains configuration files required by all programs.
* This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
* For example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf

### /dev – Device Files

* Contains device files.
* These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
* For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

### /proc – Process Information

* Contains information about system process.
* This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory * contains information about the process with that particular pid.
* This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime

### /var – Variable Files

* var stands for variable files.
* Content of the files that are expected to grow can be found under this directory.
* This includes — system log files (/var/log); packages and database files (/var/lib); emails (/var/mail); print queues (/var/spool); lock files (/var/lock); temp files needed across reboots (/var/tmp);

###/tmp – Temporary Files

* Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
* Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

###/usr – User Programs

* Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
* /usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If you can’t find a user binary under /bin, look under /usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
* /usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators. If you can’t find a system binary under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
* /usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
* /usr/local contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2

#### /home – Home Directories

* Home directories for all users to store their personal files.


### Programm algorithm

1) order randomly
2) select odd or even depending on timestamp last sign
3) order randomly again
4) reject each second index
5) order random again
6) get random number
